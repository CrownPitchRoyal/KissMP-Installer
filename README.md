# KissMP-Installer
Simple Windows Forms app that downloads the latest KissMP publish and installs the mod in the mods folder and bridge in a selected folder. Makes a bat and places a shortcut on the desktop. The bat file is used to start the bridge and the game at once. Also adds a placeholder icon. A few things need fixing. To be done in next few days.


TODO:
 - Mid-installation cancelation rollback(backup files that are to be replaced and restore them in case the user decides to cancel installation)
 - Detect if installer files exist from previous installations and display a menu with options such as: Repair/reinstall, Uninstall,...?
 - Check for registery entries https://discord.com/channels/770228946276450334/770228946905071650/863508184454397963
